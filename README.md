FitnessOverlays generates clean, customizable activity overlays from Strava data, designed for social sharing.

---

## Why

Strava’s built-in activity overlays are limited, mostly locked behind a premium paywall, and not optimized for export-quality sharing.

FitnessOverlays solves this by letting athletes create better overlays from their activity data without relying on Strava’s premium features.

---

## What It Does

- Secure OAuth connection to Strava
- Client-side Canvas rendering for deterministic overlays
- Route map rendering from activity data
- Export transparent PNGs for social platforms

---

## Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (React, TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, Shadcn/UI
- **Data**: PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js
- **Canvas**: Fabric.js

## Notes
